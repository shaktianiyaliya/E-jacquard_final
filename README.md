Slave device is used to control the CL card which in turn is inserted to modular
device of the Jacquard machine. Modular device has hooks to which the thread is 
inserted .Master device has UI application which is used by the user to input 
all the required data for the weaving. Master sends that data to the slave 
device through serial interface. Slave device controls the weaving operation a
nd distribution of the weaving data.
